# impro-PIN-database
The program is tailored to the needs of distributors of a multi-level marketing company called
PT. Immunotec Profarmasia in Jakarta, Indonesia.
It is equaivalent to a digital ledger for the distributors that helps to increase their productivity. However, please note
that the program has no access to the aforementioned company's database (which is expected), 
so information has to be entered manually and are known only to the person using it.

Basic operations include searching, adding and editing/removing records from the database. There are more sophisticated features
such as showing the information of direct children of a distributor, saving the result of searches into a .xls file, and saving 
changes that have been made to a particular record and showing these changes to the user when asked to.

Each member consists of:
- an IP (equaivalent of member ID)
- a PIN (second layer password)
- a Name
