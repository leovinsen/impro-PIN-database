# impro-PIN-database
The program was written for distributors of PT. Immunotec Profarmasia in Jakarta, Indonesia.
It is equivalent to a digital ledger that stores information of downlines of the user.

Basic operations include searching, adding and editing/removing records. There are more sophisticated features
such as showing the information of a disributor's downline, saving the result of a query into a .xls file, and displaying a history of changes made to a particular record.

Each member consists of:
- an IP (equaivalent of member ID)
- a PIN (second layer password)
- a Name
